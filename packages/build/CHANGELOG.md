# Changelog

## 0.6.1

### Docs

- Clarify that `devCss` must include Vite's `?direct` query (e.g. `/styles/style.css?direct`). Without it Vite serves a processed CSS module as `text/javascript`, which the browser refuses as a stylesheet — so the link silently does nothing and the FOUC remains. No code change; the plugin already passes the value through verbatim (so `public/`/CDN URLs without `?direct` keep working).

## 0.6.0

Dev stylesheet link (no more FOUC).

### Added

- `grasprBuild({ devCss })` (also settable as `devCss` in `site.config.js`) -- dev-only URL of the source stylesheet, e.g. `/styles/style.css`. When set, dev pages render a real render-blocking `<link rel="stylesheet">` instead of relying on JS-injected CSS, eliminating the flash of unstyled content on load and navigation. Vite still hot-reloads the linked stylesheet, so HMR is unaffected. The production build ignores it (it uses the hashed CSS from the manifest). Defaults to unset — unchanged behavior.

## 0.5.0

Browser-safe module runtime.

### Fixed

- `@phillipsharring/graspr-build/modules` no longer pulls Node-only code into app browser bundles. `modules.mjs` previously co-located the runtime helper `initModules()` with the build-time `resolveModuleDirs()`, which does `import { existsSync } from 'node:fs'`. Any app whose browser entry imported `initModules` (e.g. to init a module like handlr-module-landing) failed its production `rollup` build with `"existsSync" is not exported by "__vite-browser-external"`. The runtime side is now free of `node:` imports, and a test guards against regressions.

### Changed (breaking)

- **`resolveModuleDirs()` moved** from `@phillipsharring/graspr-build/modules` to a new build-only subpath `@phillipsharring/graspr-build/module-dirs`. It touches the filesystem, so it no longer ships alongside the browser-safe runtime. It is still re-exported from the package root (`@phillipsharring/graspr-build`).
  - **Migration:** in your build script / `vite.config.js`, change
    `import { resolveModuleDirs } from '@phillipsharring/graspr-build/modules'`
    to `import { resolveModuleDirs } from '@phillipsharring/graspr-build/module-dirs'`.
  - `@phillipsharring/graspr-build/modules` still exports the browser-safe `initModules`, `configure`, and `moduleRoot` — those imports are unchanged.

## 0.4.0

Dist shape options.

### Added

- `buildPages({ flatRoutes: true })` -- emit extensionless sibling files (`dist/about`) instead of directory-style `dist/about/index.html`, for hosts that serve abstract URLs (`/about`, not `/about/`). Replaces the per-site `scripts/flatten-dist.mjs` post-processor that consumers were copying around.
  - **Configured once in `site.config.js`** via a `flatRoutes` field. The `graspr-build-pages` CLI forwards it to the build, and `grasprBuild({ siteConfig })` falls back to the same field, so dev and prod read one source of truth. The explicit `flatRoutes` option on `buildPages()`/`grasprBuild()` still overrides.
  - Root stays `dist/index.html`; the `404` page is kept as `dist/404.html` by default.
  - Override the keep-list with route keys: `flatRoutes: { keepExtension: ['404', 'errors/offline'] }`. The list replaces the default.
  - Nested-route conflicts (a `/blog/` page flattening to `dist/blog` while a `/blog/post/` page needs `dist/blog/` to be a directory) are a hard error naming both source files — same conflict semantics as the cross-root duplicate-route check.
  - The `grasprBuild()` Vite plugin accepts the same option. Dev serving is unchanged (it already resolves `/about` without redirects); the option only runs the matching nested-route conflict check so `vite dev` fails like `npm run build`.
  - Default `flatRoutes: false` — no behavior change.
- `buildPages({ minify: true })` -- minify each baked page via the optional `html-minifier-terser` peer dependency.
  - Also configured via a `minify` field in `site.config.js`, forwarded by the `graspr-build-pages` CLI (same centralized pattern as `flatRoutes`).
  - `true` uses sensible defaults (`removeAttributeQuotes`, `collapseWhitespace`, `removeComments`, `removeRedundantAttributes`, `removeScriptTypeAttributes`, `removeTagWhitespace`); pass an object to override individual options (merged onto the defaults).
  - `html-minifier-terser` is declared as an optional peer dependency — loaded lazily only when minify is on. If it's requested but missing, the build throws a clear install hint before rendering any page.
  - Build-only: `vite dev` always serves unminified HTML. Default `minify: false` — no behavior change.
- README gains a **Hosting** section covering `Content-Type` tagging for extensionless objects on S3.

### Fixed

- `buildPages()` now deletes `dist/.vite/manifest.json` (and the `.vite/` dir if empty) after baking asset hashes into the pages. Previously the build-internal manifest was left in `dist/` and a naive `aws s3 sync dist/` shipped it to the public bucket. No-ops when the manifest isn't present (e.g. `buildPages()` called without a preceding `vite build`). Consumers no longer need `--exclude '.vite/*'` on their sync.

## 0.3.6

### Fixed

- HTML compiler: tolerate whitespace before `>` in component end tags. The HTML5 spec allows `</tag\s*>`, and Prettier emits the `</tag\n>` form when wrapping long attribute lists on inline elements. Previously the literal `indexOf('</tag>')` lookup missed those and threw `Unclosed <tag> tag`. `findMatchingCloseForTag` now returns `{ start, end }` instead of a bare index so callers don't have to assume the close tag length.

## 0.3.5

### Fixed

- Vite dev plugin: 301-redirect directory-style URLs missing their trailing slash (e.g. `/admin` → `/admin/`) when the resolved page is an `index.html`. Without this, the URL bar would show the slash-less form, which breaks downstream consumers that match on path prefixes (e.g. `path.startsWith('/admin/')`) and also diverges from prod CloudFront behavior. Query strings are preserved.

## 0.3.4

### Added

- `[[moduleAdminNav]]` layout placeholder -- generates admin nav links from modules that declare `adminNav` in their defaults. Respects `configure(mod, { adminNav: false })` to disable. Outputs `<a data-nav-section>` elements matching the existing admin nav pattern.

## 0.3.3

### Added

- `moduleRoot(importMetaUrl)` -- resolves a module's root directory from `import.meta.url` using the URL standard. Works in both Node and browser contexts without Node-only imports. Modules use this instead of `node:url` + `node:path` boilerplate.

## 0.3.2

### Added

- `initModules(modules)` -- iterates the modules array from `site.config.js` and calls `init()` on each module object that provides one. Apps call this once from their entry JS.

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- `resolveModuleDirs()` no longer throws when a module's `pagesDir` or `componentsDir` doesn't exist on disk. This happens when npm skips empty directories during publish. The dir is silently skipped instead.

## 0.3.0

Module system.

### Added

- `configure(mod, overrides)` -- shallow-merges site-specific config onto a module's defaults. Modules registered without `configure()` use their own defaults.
- `resolveModuleDirs(rootDir, modules)` -- resolves an array of module entries into `pagesDirs` and `componentsDirs` for graspr-build. Accepts both module objects (from npm packages, self-resolving via `import.meta.url`) and legacy strings (local directory names under `modules/`).
- New export path: `@phillipsharring/graspr-build/modules` for the module utilities.

### How it works

Modules are plain objects with `name`, `pagesDir`, `componentsDir`, `defaults`, `config`, and `init()`. They self-resolve their own filesystem paths, so the build system just reads what the module declares rather than guessing paths by convention. This enables modules distributed as npm packages.

```js
// site.config.js
import { landing } from '@phillipsharring/handlr-module-landing';
import { configure } from '@phillipsharring/graspr-build/modules';

export default {
    modules: [
        landing,                                // uses defaults
        configure(landing, { adminNav: false }), // overridden
    ],
};
```

## 0.2.1

### Fixed

- Component templates are now trimmed of surrounding whitespace before substitution. The trailing newline that every editor (and POSIX) adds to text files was bleeding into the page after inline components, so `<lnk>here</lnk>,` rendered as `here ,` instead of `here,`. Block-level components were unaffected because the surrounding block context was already collapsing the whitespace.

## 0.2.0

Multi-root page discovery for frontend modules.

### Added

- `buildPages({ pagesDirs })` and `grasprBuild({ pagesDirs })` accept an array of page directories. Files from all roots are merged and routed by their relative path within their own root, so a module's `modules/blog/pages/posts/index.html` produces `/posts/` exactly the way `content/pages/posts/index.html` would.
- `componentsDirs` option exposed alongside the existing back-compat `componentsDir`. Internally `renderPage()` already supported arrays  - this just plumbs the option through `buildPages()` and the dev plugin.
- Test suite (`npm test`, runs on `node:test`) covering multi-root walking, conflict detection, ordering, and back-compat.

### Changed

- Cross-root route conflicts are now a **hard error** in both `buildPages()` and the dev plugin (was: warn + skip in `buildPages()`, undefined behavior in dev). Error messages name both source files. Mirrors the route conflict semantics in `handlr-framework` v0.5.

### Back-compat

- `pagesDir` (singular) and `componentsDir` (singular) still work. If both the singular and plural form are provided, the plural wins.

## 0.1.0

Initial release. Extracted from `graspr-app-skeleton`'s `scripts/` directory and `vite.config.js` plugin block.

### Exports

- `renderPage(...)`  - single-page HTML compiler with custom-tag expansion, layout resolution, `<page-head>` extraction, and `[[prop]]`/`[[#if]]`/`[[slot]]` interpolation
- `buildPages({ root, siteConfig, ... })`  - bake every page under `content/pages/` to `dist/<route>/index.html`
- `grasprBuild({ siteConfig })` from `@phillipsharring/graspr-build/vite`  - Vite dev middleware that renders pages on the fly during `vite dev`
- `graspr-build-pages` bin  - CLI shim around `buildPages()` for use in `package.json` scripts

### API notes

- `renderPage`'s `componentsDir` parameter accepts **either a string or an array of strings**. The compiler tries each directory in order when resolving a custom tag, enabling future module systems to contribute partials from multiple roots without breaking single-root callers.
